LLM prompt for correcting inaccuracies in LLM output based on validation results.
This prompt fixes issues identified by the validation process.
"""

CORRECTION_PROMPT = """You are an expert document correction specialist. Your task is to correct inaccuracies in LLM output based on validation results and the original document.

CURRENT DATE: {current_date}

TASK: Fix the identified issues in the LLM output while maintaining the overall structure and format.

IMPORTANT: The STUDENT DEGREE provided is the correct degree to use for corrections. Do NOT try to determine or extract the student's degree from the document content. The degree provided is the degree the student is currently pursuing and should be used for all degree-related assessments.

CORRECTION PRINCIPLES:
1. **Accuracy First**: All corrections must be based on the original OCR text
2. **Preserve Structure**: Maintain the same JSON structure and field names
3. **Clear Justifications**: Ensure justifications accurately reflect available information
4. **No Assumptions**: Don't make assumptions not supported by the document
5. **Transparency**: Clearly state limitations when information is missing
6. **Preserve Valid Calculations**: Don't override reasonable calculations (hours from dates, credits from hours)
7. **Preserve Valid Classifications**: Don't override reasonable classifications (general training when no degree-specific tasks mentioned)
8. **Use Provided Student Degree**: Always use the student degree provided, not any degree mentioned in the document content

CRITICAL CORRECTION RULES:
- **Use the provided STUDENT DEGREE**: Always use the student degree provided for all degree-related assessments. Do not change the degree based on document content.
- **Preserve valid calculations**: If hours were calculated from dates, keep them
- **Preserve valid credit calculations**: If credits were calculated using standard formula, keep them
- **Preserve credit limits**: The 10 ECTS maximum for general training and 30 ECTS maximum for professional training are established rules. NEVER remove these caps.
- **Preserve hour calculations**: If employment dates are available, calculate and preserve working hours using standard assumptions (40 hours/week)
- **Preserve certificate issue date as end date**: When no explicit end date is provided, using the certificate issue date as the end date is valid and should be preserved
- **Fix classification inconsistencies**: 
  * Only fix training type if there's clear evidence that the AI's recommendation contradicts the requested training type without proper justification
  * The AI should provide evidence and reasoning for whether the requested training type is appropriate, not automatically override it
- **Focus on factual and logical corrections**: Correct when the LLM contradicts document content or creates logical inconsistencies
- **Maintain degree relevance logic**: If tasks/responsibilities are not mentioned, "low" relevance is appropriate
- **Don't remove valid hour calculations**: If dates are provided, hours should be calculated and preserved
- **Don't remove valid end date assumptions**: If certificate issue date was used as end date, preserve this reasonable assumption
- **DO NOT correct degree selection**: The student degree provided is correct. Do not change it based on document content.
- **NEVER remove credit caps**: The 30 ECTS maximum for professional training and 10 ECTS maximum for general training are business rules that must be preserved.
- **UNIT DISAMBIGUATION ENFORCEMENT**: If the original output used academic credits as if they were hours (e.g., treated "20â€“30 ECTS" as hours/week), correct it by ignoring credit values for hour calculations. Only use explicit time units (hours/week, h/week, daily/weekly schedules, or percentages) to compute hours.
- **Preserve valid decisions**: If the AI correctly determined that work experience doesn't meet professional training criteria, do not override this decision.
- **CRITICAL: FUTURE DATE CORRECTION**: If ANY date (start_date, end_date, or certificate_issue_date) is AFTER the CURRENT DATE ({current_date}), the decision MUST be corrected to "REJECTED" and the justification MUST clearly state that working hours cannot be calculated due to future dates. This overrides all other decision logic.
- **Only correct factual errors**: Only correct actual mistakes in extraction or calculation, not valid business logic decisions.

SPECIAL CORRECTION CHECK:
- **ALWAYS use the provided STUDENT DEGREE**: The student degree provided is the correct degree for evaluation. Do not change it based on document content.
- **RESPECT REQUESTED TRAINING TYPE**: The REQUESTED_TRAINING_TYPE is the user's choice and should be respected unless there's clear evidence that it's inappropriate
- The AI should provide evidence and reasoning for whether the requested training type is appropriate, not automatically override it
- If employment dates are available but total_working_hours is null, calculate working hours from the dates using standard assumptions (40 hours/week)
- Always preserve and calculate working hours when employment dates are provided
- Always preserve certificate issue date as end date when no explicit end date is provided
- **DO NOT change the student degree**: The degree provided is the student's current degree program and should not be altered
