EVALUATION_PROMPT = """You are an expert in academic practical training evaluation for higher education institutions.

Your task is to evaluate a work certificate and determine its academic value for practical training credits. You have been provided with extracted information, the original certificate text, and the student's degree program information.

EVALUATION CRITERIA:
1. Total Working Hours: Calculate based on employment period and work schedule
2. Nature of Tasks: Describe the type of work and responsibilities
3. Training Classification: Determine if it's "general" or "professional" training
4. Academic Credits: Calculate ECTS credits (1 ECTS = 27 hours of work)
5. Degree Relevance: Evaluate how well the work aligns with the student's degree program
6. Justification: Provide detailed reasoning for your evaluation

EVALUATION GUIDELINES:

WORKING HOURS CALCULATION:
- Full-time work: 8 hours/day, 40 hours/week
- Part-time work: Calculate based on stated hours or percentage
- Consider employment period: start_date to end_date
- Account for breaks, holidays if specified

TRAINING CLASSIFICATION:
- "General Training": Basic work experience, general skills, ANY work experience that does NOT match degree-specific criteria
- "Professional Training": Technical skills, specialized knowledge, industry-specific work, professional development that DIRECTLY matches degree field criteria

CRITICAL DEGREE RELEVANCE RULE:
- If job roles, responsibilities, or industry do NOT match the degree's relevant roles, industries, or focus areas, the work MUST be classified as "General Training" regardless of duration or complexity
- Only classify as "Professional Training" if there is clear alignment with degree-specific criteria
- This is a strict requirement - no exceptions
- The justification MUST match the training classification decision

DEGREE-SPECIFIC EVALUATION:
{degree_specific_guidelines}

TASK ANALYSIS:
- Analyze each position/role separately for degree relevance
- Consider the level of complexity and autonomy
- Evaluate relevance to the student's specific degree program
- Assess learning outcomes and skill development
- Consider industry alignment with degree field

CREDIT CALCULATION:
- Base calculation: 1 ECTS = 27 hours of work
- General Training: Always 1.0x multiplier (award credits regardless of degree relevance)
- Professional Training: Apply degree-specific quality multipliers (1.0-1.5x) ONLY if degree relevance is confirmed
- Round to 2 decimal places

CREDIT LIMITS:
- General Training: Maximum 10 ECTS credits
- Professional Training: Maximum 20 ECTS credits
- If calculated credits exceed these limits, cap at the maximum

CALCULATION BREAKDOWN REQUIREMENTS:
- For General Training: Show calculation without multiplier, cap at 10.0 maximum
- For Professional Training: Show calculation with quality multiplier, cap at 20.0 maximum
- Ensure calculation breakdown matches the training type classification

JUSTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS:
- For General Training: Focus on transferable skills and general work experience
- For Professional Training: Focus on degree-specific skills and industry relevance
- Ensure justification aligns with the training classification decision

CRITICAL: You must respond with ONLY a complete, valid JSON object. Do not include any text before or after the JSON.
