RESPONSE LENGTH REQUIREMENT:

RESPONSE STRUCTURE:

2. Include specific sources, URLs, and verification details
3. Explain your research process and findings thoroughly

VALIDATION CRITERIA:
1. **Company Existence & Legitimacy**: 
   - Does this company actually exist based on internet research?
   - Is this a real business with online presence?
   - What evidence did you find online?

2. **Contact Information Verification**:
   - Does the provided phone/email/address match what's found online?
   - Are there any discrepancies between provided and online information?

3. **Business Operations**:
   - What industry does the company operate in?
   - Are there recent activities or news about the company?
   - Does the company have a legitimate online presence?

4. **Risk Assessment**:
   - Based on internet research, what's the likelihood this is legitimate?
   - Any red flags or suspicious findings online?

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Provide a detailed, evidence-based justification explaining why the company is legitimate or suspicious based on your internet research.

Format: "The company [COMPANY_NAME] appears legitimate because [detailed justification with specific evidence found online]." OR "The company [COMPANY_NAME] appears suspicious because [detailed explanation of what you found or didn't find online]."

Example:
"The company Teboil Paimio appears legitimate because I found corroborating evidence across multiple online sources. First, a search for \"Teboil Paimio Sauvontie 9\" confirms the address listed is a Teboil service station. Several websites, including Fonecta.fi (https://www.fonecta.fi/yritykset/Paimio/283756/Teboil+Paimio), show Teboil Paimio operating at Sauvontie 9, 21510 Hevonpää. Further, a search for \"Teboil Paimio business registry Finland\" leads to information on the Finnish Business Information System (YTJ), although a direct link to a company profile with only that exact name was not immediately found. However, searching the YTJ system using the provided Business ID (0798365-2) reveals that the ID is associated with a company named \"TEBOIL EXPRESS PAIMIO KAUPPIAAT OY\" (https://tietopalvelu.ytj.fi/yritystiedot.aspx?yid=0798365-2&tarkiste=C4562A2C4E782B4896EE465269816F2A4463E4B0), whose registered address matches Sauvontie 9, 21510 Hevonpää. This suggests that \"Teboil Paimio\" is a trading name or location of the registered company \"TEBOIL EXPRESS PAIMIO KAUPPIAAT OY.\" The provided email address, paimio@huoltoasemat.teboil.fi, also aligns with Teboil's general structure for its service station email addresses. I also found mentions of the Teboil Paimio service station on various online forums and directories related to Paimio, further supporting its existence as a local business. Finally, the main Teboil website, teboil.fi, confirms that Teboil is a legitimate and well-established fuel retailer in Finland."

Include specific evidence from your internet research: websites found, business registry matches, news articles, company activities, etc.

EXAMPLE OF EXPECTED RESEARCH-BASED RESPONSE:
"The company Teboil Paimio appears legitimate because I found their official website at teboil.fi, verified their business registration in the Finnish Y-tunnus database with ID 0798365-2, and confirmed their address at Sauvontie 9, 21510 Hevonpää matches their registered location. The company is a well-established Finnish fuel retailer with multiple locations across Finland."

Your response must include:
1. A detailed justification paragraph with comprehensive evidence
2. Specific URLs, database matches, news sources, and other evidence found
3. Real web search results with actual findings and sources

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Be thorough in your analysis but avoid overthinking
- If any information is missing, note it but don't automatically reject
- Focus on obvious red flags and clear legitimacy indicators
- Provide specific, actionable feedback in your notes
- Use common sense business judgment
- Remember that legitimate companies can have various naming conventions and formats

COMPANY HIERARCHY HANDLING:
- When validating companies, consider that they might be subsidiaries or locations of larger parent companies
- Search for both the specific company name AND potential parent company names
- Example: "Tampereen Tehdas" might be a factory of "PILKINGTON NSG Group"
- Validate the parent company if the specific location doesn't return results
- This helps with companies that operate under different trading names or locations

RESPONSE REQUIREMENTS:
- RESEARCH the company online using web search capabilities
- Write a detailed justification paragraph explaining why the company is legitimate or suspicious
- Use the exact format: "The company [COMPANY_NAME] appears legitimate because [detailed evidence from internet research]." OR "The company [COMPANY_NAME] appears suspicious because [detailed explanation of what you found or didn't find online]."
- Include specific evidence: websites found, business registry matches, news articles, company activities
- Base your assessment on actual internet findings, not just the provided information

CRITICAL: Your response must be a detailed, comprehensive paragraph explaining your findings with full evidence. Do not provide a short, generic response. Include specific details about what you found online, including URLs, database matches, and verification processes. Be thorough in your research explanation.
