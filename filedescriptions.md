ocr_service.py

The OCRService class is the core document processing engine that extracts text from various file formats (PDFs, images) using multiple strategies.
ðŸ”§ What It Does Step by Step
1. Smart Processing Strategy
File Input â†’ Determine Type â†’ Choose Best Method â†’ Extract Text â†’ Return Results
2. File Type Detection
PDFs: Uses PyMuPDF for fast text extraction, falls back to OCR if needed
Images: Uses OCR (Tesseract + Google Vision fallback)
Other formats: Returns error for unsupported types
3. Processing Methods
For PDFs:
First Try: PyMuPDF direct text extraction (fast, accurate)
Quality Check: If text quality is poor (< 30% confidence), fallback to OCR
OCR Fallback: Convert PDF to images, then use Tesseract/Google Vision
For Images:
Preprocessing: Apply image enhancement (grayscale, binarization, noise removal)
Primary OCR: Tesseract
Fallback OCR: Google Vision API (if available)
4. Key Features
Smart Decision Making:
    # Tries PyMuPDF first (fast)
if quality_score > 30.0 and len(extracted_text.strip()) > 50:
    return PyMuPDF_result
else:
    # Falls back to OCR (slower but more reliable)
    return OCR_result

Multiple OCR Engines:
Tesseract: Primary OCR (free, local)
Google Vision: Fallback OCR (cloud-based, more accurate)
Quality Assessment:
Calculates confidence scores
Determines if results are successful
Provides processing statistics
5. Output Format
Returns an OCRResult object containing:
Extracted text (string)
Confidence score (0-100%)
Engine used (pymupdf/tesseract/google_vision)
Processing time (seconds)
Success status (boolean)
