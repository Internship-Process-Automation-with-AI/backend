## What is OCR?

OCR (Optical Character Recognition) converts images, PDFs, and documents into readable text. Our system is specially designed for processing work certificates and academic documents.

## What Files Can We Process?

- **PDF files** (.pdf)
- **Word documents** (.docx, .doc) 
- **Images** (.png, .jpg, .jpeg, .bmp, .tiff)

## How It Works (Simple Version)

### Step 1: File Type Detection & Processing
The system automatically detects your file type and uses the most appropriate processing method:

#### **Word Documents (.docx, .doc)**
- **Processing Method**: Direct text extraction using python-docx library
- **Speed**: Fastest (1-3 seconds)
- **Accuracy**: 95-99% (extracts native text, no OCR needed)
- **What Happens**: Opens the document and reads the actual text content directly

#### **PDF Files (.pdf)**
- **Processing Method**: PDF ‚Üí Image conversion ‚Üí OCR processing
- **Speed**: Medium (5-15 seconds depending on page count)
- **Accuracy**: 85-95% (depends on PDF quality)
- **What Happens**: 
  1. Converts each PDF page to high-resolution image
  2. Runs OCR on each image
  3. Combines text from all pages

#### **Image Files (.png, .jpg, .jpeg, .bmp, .tiff)**
- **Processing Method**: Direct OCR processing
- **Speed**: Medium (3-10 seconds)
- **Accuracy**: 70-90% (depends on image quality and text clarity)
- **What Happens**: Runs OCR directly on the image without conversion

### Step 2: Language Detection & Optimization
The system automatically detects the document language and applies specialized processing:

#### **Finnish Documents**
- **Detection Method**: Scans for Finnish characters (√§, √∂, √•) and common Finnish words
- **OCR Engine**: Uses Tesseract with Finnish language pack (`fin`)
- **Special Features**:
  - Recognizes Finnish business terms (ty√∂todistus, harjoittelu, ty√∂paikka)
  - Handles Finnish date formats (1.1.2024, 1. tammikuuta)
  - Optimized for Finnish company names and addresses
- **Processing Time**: Same as other languages
- **Accuracy**: 5-10% better than generic OCR for Finnish text

#### **English Documents**
- **Detection Method**: Scans for English words and sentence structure
- **OCR Engine**: Uses Tesseract with English language pack (`eng`)
- **Special Features**:
  - Recognizes English business terminology
  - Handles English date formats (January 1, 2024, 01/01/2024)
  - Optimized for international company names
- **Processing Time**: Same as other languages
- **Accuracy**: Standard OCR accuracy for English text

#### **Mixed Language Documents**
- **Detection Method**: Identifies primary language, then processes accordingly
- **Processing**: Uses the detected primary language's optimization
- **Fallback**: If uncertain, defaults to English processing

### Step 3: Text Extraction & Processing
Based on the detected language and file type:

#### **For Finnish Documents:**
1. **Character Recognition**: Special handling for √§, √∂, √• characters
2. **Word Correction**: Finnish-specific spell checking and correction
3. **Business Term Recognition**: Identifies Finnish work certificate terminology
4. **Format Handling**: Recognizes Finnish business document formats

#### **For English Documents:**
1. **Standard OCR**: Uses English language optimization
2. **Business Recognition**: Identifies English business document patterns
3. **Format Handling**: Recognizes international document formats

### Step 4: Quality Assessment & Confidence Scoring
The system evaluates the quality of extracted text:

#### **Confidence Levels:**
- **High Confidence (80-100%)**: 
  - Text is very accurate
  - Minimal corrections needed
  - Suitable for immediate AI processing
  
- **Medium Confidence (50-79%)**: 
  - Text is generally good
  - Some corrections may be needed
  - Still suitable for AI processing with minor adjustments
  
- **Low Confidence (0-49%)**: 
  - Text may have significant errors
  - Manual review recommended
  - May need re-scanning with better quality

#### **Quality Factors:**
- **Image Resolution**: Higher DPI = better accuracy
- **Text Clarity**: Clear, dark text on light background
- **Document Condition**: Clean, unmarked documents
- **Language Complexity**: Technical terms may reduce confidence

## What You Get from OCR

### OCR Output Format
```python
{
    "success": True,
    "text_length": 1250,           # Number of characters extracted
    "detected_language": "fin",     # Language detected (fin/eng)
    "confidence": 84.5,            # OCR confidence score (0-100%)
    "processing_time": 3.2,        # Time taken for OCR processing
    "extracted_text": "Your extracted text here...",
    "file_type": "pdf",            # Original file type processed
    "ocr_engine": "tesseract"      # OCR engine used
}
```

### OCR Results Storage
When using the API, OCR results are stored in the database:

#### **Certificates Table** (OCR-specific data):
- **File content**: Original file stored as `BYTEA`
- **OCR output**: Extracted text stored as `TEXT` in `ocr_output` field
- **File metadata**: Filename, filetype, training_type, uploaded_at
- **Processing info**: When OCR was completed and with what settings

## OCR-Specific API Endpoints

### **OCR Processing:**
- **Process Certificate**: `POST /certificate/{certificate_id}/process` - Runs OCR on uploaded file
- **Get Status**: `GET /certificate/{certificate_id}/status` - Check OCR processing status
- **Preview Certificate**: `GET /certificate/{certificate_id}/preview` - View original file

### **File Upload (Required for OCR):**
- **Upload Certificate**: `POST /student/{student_id}/upload-certificate` - Upload file before OCR processing

## Common OCR Questions

### Q: How accurate is the OCR?
**A:** It depends on the file type:
- Word documents: 95-99% (very accurate - no OCR needed)
- Good quality PDFs: 85-95% (quite accurate)
- Poor quality scans: 70-90% (may have some errors)

### Q: Does it work with Finnish documents?
**A:** Yes! The system is specially optimized for Finnish:
- Recognizes Finnish characters (√§, √∂, √•)
- Detects Finnish words automatically
- Uses Finnish-specific OCR language pack
- 5-10% better accuracy for Finnish text

### Q: What if the OCR fails?
**A:** The system has multiple fallback strategies:
- Tries different processing methods
- Uses different language settings
- Always returns something (even if confidence is low)
- Logs errors for debugging

### Q: How fast is OCR processing?
**A:** Processing speed depends on file type:
- Word documents: Very fast (1-3 seconds, no OCR needed)
- PDFs: Medium speed (5-15 seconds, depends on page count)
- Images: Medium speed (3-10 seconds, direct OCR)

### Q: Can I process files through the API?
**A:** Yes! The system provides OCR-specific endpoints:
- Upload files: `/student/{student_id}/upload-certificate`
- Run OCR: `/certificate/{certificate_id}/process`
- Check status: `/certificate/{certificate_id}/status`

## Tips for Best OCR Results

### ‚úÖ Do This
- Use good quality scans (300 DPI or higher)
- Ensure documents are well-lit and clear
- Use standard file formats (PDF, DOCX, PNG)
- Clean, unmarked documents
- High contrast text (dark text on light background)

### ‚ùå Avoid This
- Very low quality scans (below 150 DPI)
- Documents with heavy shadows or blur
- Unusual file formats
- Handwritten text (system designed for printed text)
- Documents with heavy annotations or stamps

## OCR's Role in the System

The OCR system is the **first step** in a larger AI pipeline:
1. **Extracts text** (OCR step) - This is what this guide covers
2. **Analyzes content** (AI evaluation) - Uses the extracted text
3. **Validates companies** (Company verification) - Based on extracted text
4. **Makes decisions** (ACCEPTED/REJECTED) - Based on AI analysis
5. **Provides recommendations** (for rejected cases)

**The OCR provides the text input** that the AI system uses to evaluate work certificates and determine academic credits. Without good OCR results, the AI cannot make accurate decisions.

## OCR Database Storage

### **OCR Data Storage:**

#### **Certificates Table** (where OCR results are stored):
- `certificate_id` (UUID, Primary Key)
- `file_content` (BYTEA) - Original uploaded file
- `ocr_output` (TEXT) - **Extracted text from OCR processing**
- `filename` (VARCHAR) - Original filename
- `filetype` (VARCHAR) - File extension (.pdf, .docx, .png, etc.)
- `uploaded_at` (TIMESTAMP) - When file was uploaded

### **OCR Processing Workflow:**
1. **Upload**: File is uploaded and stored in `certificates` table
2. **OCR Processing**: Text is extracted and stored in `ocr_output` field
3. **Result**: Extracted text is ready for AI processing

**Note**: The `decisions` table stores AI evaluation results, not OCR data. This guide focuses on OCR processing only.

## Summary

Our OCR system is:
- **Smart**: Automatically detects languages and file types
